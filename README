* Brief description:

This is a Java-based LysKOM[1] client library. The project focuses on
creating a useful class library making it easy for developers to
create new LysKOM clients in Java.

LysKOM is a conference system with ancient roots. LysKOM is a
relatively new approach to the old-fashioned KOM system, where the
communication is client-server based rather than terminal-based. The
most widely used client today[2] is written in Elisp and run inside
Emacs. LysKOM was created at the Lysator Academic Computer Society[3]
at Linköpings Universitet[4].

This project aims to implement all features of the latest LysKOM
protocol A specification[5].

* About the code - the usual disclaimer, but for real

This code _is_ ugly. I'm only releasing it because that makes more
sense than letting it grow old in my own digital attics. Also, I'm
hoping to get some of my enthusiasm back if I get some help.


* Authors:

The original author of this code is Rasmus Sten
<rasmus@halogen.com>. Staffan Malmgren <staffan@ehand.se> was the
first person to see the code, and has provided bug fixes, features,
test implementations, documentation and more.


* License

The license of this the "MIT License". Put shortly, you can do
anything you want with this code, but don't blame its authors. See the
file "LICENSE".
